------** Set permission for the laravel project
cd [..LARAVEL PROJECT ROOT]
sudo find . -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
sudo find . -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
sudo chmod -R 777 ./storage
sudo chmod -R 777 ./bootstrap/cache/
Only if you use npm (VUE, compiling SASS, etc..) add this:

sudo chmod -R 777 ./node_modules/
What it does:

Change all file permissions to 644
Change all folder permissions to 755
For storage and bootstrap cache (special folders used by laravel for creating and executing files, not available from outside) set permission to 777, for anything inside
For nodeJS executable, same as above
Note: Maybe you can not, or don't need, to do it with sudo prefix. it depends on your user's permissions, group, etc...
